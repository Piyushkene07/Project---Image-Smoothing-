Project Topic: - Smooth an image using k-nearest Neighbours algorithm, with k given by the user



Steps : ->

1.Use the given file (Final_SIP_Project.exe).
2.GUI pop up will come, through "open" button in file menu choose any image that you want to smooth.
3.Provide value of convolution matrix size and k nearest neighbours.
4.Press "submit" button.
5.In the back end code will run (Depending on size of n,k and image size it will take some time.)
6.Finally the required smoothen image will appear in gui.
7.you can use "save as" option from "file" menu to save output image in desired directory.
8.similarily use "exit" option from "file" menu to exit from gui.
